// Note: Supabase session check for admin role should ideally happen in a layout or middleware for client components,
// or data fetching should be done in a server component and passed as props.
// For simplicity here, we'll assume initialData is fetched by a server component wrapper if this page were fully client-side.
// However, since the prompt implies modifying the existing page which fetches data,
// we'll adapt it to fetch data client-side on mount or use router.refresh() which re-runs server logic.

// To keep the existing server-side data fetching structure and only add client-side interaction for delete,
// we'll fetch initial data like a server component would, but make the component itself client-side for interaction.
// This is a common pattern: Server Component fetches initial data, Client Component enhances it.
// For this exercise, we'll simulate this by passing initialProducers or re-fetching.
// A simpler approach for this subtask is to make the page fully client-side for data fetching too,
// or rely on router.refresh() to update the server-fetched list.

// Let's assume this page will continue to get initial data via props after a server component fetches it,
// or it will re-fetch/rely on router.refresh().
// The prompt doesn't specify refactoring data fetching, just adding delete.

  // The session check for admin is tricky in a client component that might not have direct access like a server one.
  // This would typically be handled by page protection or API middleware for the delete action.
  // The API route for DELETE already protects itself.

  // For displaying producers, we'll use state if we were to update locally,
  // but router.refresh() makes local state for the list less critical.
  // const [producers, setProducers] = useState<Producer[]>(initialProducers || []);

  // For now, we'll assume `producers` are passed or fetched in a way that `router.refresh()` works.
  // The original page was a server component, so `producers` were directly available.
  // To make it interactive, we need client component features.

  // This component cannot be an `async function` if it's `"use client"`.
  // Data fetching will be simplified for this example to focus on the delete UI.
  // In a real app, you'd fetch `producers` in a useEffect or pass from a parent server component.
  // For this task, we'll assume `producers` are somehow provided (e.g. if this component was wrapped).
